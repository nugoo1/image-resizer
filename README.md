No problem, here you go:

```
# Image Resizer

This is a Node.js script that uses the Sharp image processing library to resize and compress images. 

## Usage

1. Place your input images in the `input` folder.
2. Run `npm start` to resize and compress the images.
3. The resized and compressed images will be output to the `output` folder.

## Options

You can modify the following options in the `index.js` file to control the image resizing and compression:

- `width`: the desired width in pixels
- `height`: the desired height in pixels
- `quality`: the desired JPEG/PNG compression quality (0-100)
```

Feel free to customize it as needed!
